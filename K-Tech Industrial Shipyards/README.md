# K-Tech Industrial shipyards 

- After speaking with several mining crews that often use the Rusatom-Antonoff-K255 Titan, the CEO of K-Tech Industrial decided to open a new shipyard department. K-Tech Industrial Shipyards has been tasked with overseeing the modification of existing ships to expand thier capabilities. 

# Department notes: 
- The `K-Tech Industrial shipyards` department adds new ship variants to the game as separate mod files. 


## K225-KTI

- The first new ship variant that K-Tech Industrial Shipyards designed was the "K225-KTI".  The original Rusatom-Antonoff AT-K225 Titan was a behemonth, however the improved "K225-KTI" variant is a true monster. Boasting two new low-stress hardpoints, two new dedicated drone hardpoints, along with an increased internal processed material storage of 26,000Kg, a reworked thruster layout, and two new high-stress hardpoints reinforced to support the ARM-1500 Salvage arms, the K225-KTI is designed to be a true workhorse in the belt.

## Kitsumo-KTI

- The second ship variant to roll out of the shipyards of K-Tech Industrial is the "Kitsumo-KTI".
The Nakamura-Dynamics designed kitsune never managed to reach the hearts of belters, often seen as a downgrade in capabilities for more money than it was worth.   The "Kitsumo-KTI" aims to aleviate some of those negative points, now boasting a forward high-stress mount compatible with special downsized versions of popular mining tools including the ARM-1500,  and a new underside mounted low-stress hardpoint for mounting mining equipment, Designers at KTI Shipyards were also able to increase the internal processed material storage to 36,000Kg by removing several layers of insulating styrofoam from the inner hull.  A single main torch finishes off the new design tweaks.
