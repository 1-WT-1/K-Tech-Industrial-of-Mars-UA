## Cothon Mk2
K-Tech Industrial Shipyards went back to the drawing board when designing their modifications to the venerable Cothon class hull.  Starting with the severe lack of crew habitation space, the R&D department managed to design a new mount capable of holding the centrifuge hab from an OCP209 Class hull. With that oversight fixed the designers worked on increasing the internal processed ore capacity, copying the "Bender" Classes innovative cargo hold, with an in house modification, the KTI Cothon MK2 is able to hold 100,000Kg processed ore of each type. In order to support this, the ship boasts an increased RCS count, as well as reinforced RCS Struts.

- Approximate cost: `600,000 E$`
- Low-Stress Hardpoints: `4`
- Crew: `8`
- Dry mass(Approximate): `103,700 kg`
- Cargo bay(Approximate): `260 m^3`
- Processed cargo storage: `100,000 kg`
- Additional RCS Mounts: `4`

\n
The Cothon Mk2.1 has an alternative RCS alignment, the boom mounted RCS are now facing the Fore(Front) and Aft(Back), while the newly mounted corner RCS thrusters are facing Port(Left) and Starboard(Right), This should provide an increase in rotational thrust without sacrificing thrust in any one direction.

- Crew: `8`
- Dry mass(Approximate): `103,700 kg`
