`K-Tech Industrial` is a mining focused company located in the Hellas Basin on mars. 

# Branches
- The main industrial branch of `K-Tech-Industrial` has a focus on creating robust industrial equipment with the durability to survive the rings of Saturn. 


# Products on the market.
- ["Block" Series MPDG](https://github.com/Kadaire/K-Tech-Industrial-of-Mars/tree/"Block"-Series-MPDG/K-Tech%20Industrial%20Block%20Series%20MPDG) The flagship product of KTI. The Block series of MPDGs were developed after seeing a gap in the availability of cheaper low power MPDGs for newly established miners, and the top end MPDGs that did not provide enough power for some of the more well established miners in the ring who have been known to apply aftermarket modifications to thier equipment which causes additional strain on the power systems. 



# Important Compatiblity Note:
**`K-Tech Industrial` Branded Mods DO NOT currently work with the Industries of Enceladus mod. There is no current workaround for this. Will update this section if that changes.**
