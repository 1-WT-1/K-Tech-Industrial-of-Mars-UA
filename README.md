# K-Tech Industrial presents the Block series MPDGs: 

A series of new MPDG's for the hard working industrial miner. 
The Micro-Block series RTG allows new miners to add a small bit of extra power for that extra kick a new tool might need. 
The Small-Block series is another entry level competitor to the MPDG market costing slightly more but producing almost 2x the power of the RTG.   
The Big-Block series is designed to be the answer to all your power generation needs. 

Mod notes: 

This mod simply aims to add a new MPDG system to the game.
The entry level option, "Micro-Block" series RTG.
The Upgrade level, "Small-Block" series MPDG. 

An optional download for the end game "Big-Block" model MPDG which installs as a separate mod due to being considerably stronger than any vanilla MPDG.
This does NOT require you to use the main "K-Tech Industrial Block series" MPDG mod, it works as a standalone or can be loaded with my other mods.
