SHIP_AT225-KTI|K-T INDUSTRIAL "Titan-XL"

SHIP_AT225-KTI_DESC| The first new ship variant that K-Tech Industrial Shipyards designed was the "K225-KTI".  The original Rusatom-Antonoff AT-K225 Titan was a behemonth, however the improved "K225-KTI" variant is a true monster. Boasting two new low-stress hardpoints, two new dedicated drone hardpoints, along with an increased internal processed material storage of 26,000Kg, a reworked thruster layout, and two new high-stress hardpoints reinforced to support the ARM-1500 Salvage arms, the K225-KTI is designed to be a true workhorse in the belt.
